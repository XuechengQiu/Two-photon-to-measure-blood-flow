# Two-photon-to-measure-blood-flow
Using line scan of two photon microscope to measure blood flow. Tiff or stacked tiff image is required.

This code is based on the publication from "Chhatbar, Pratik Yashvant, and Prakash Kara. Improved blood velocity measurements with a hybrid image filtering and iterative Radon transform algorithm. Frontiers in neuroscience 7 (2013): 106."
